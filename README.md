The **Grocery Giggle** project is a Python-based application designed to provide a seamless and interactive grocery shopping experience. Developed using the Tkinter library, this mini project features a dynamic interface that allows users to browse various product categories, including fresh fruits, dairy products, vegetables, and toiletries. The interface is scrollable for easy navigation, and each product category is presented in an organized grid layout with selectable options.

The application allows users to enter their details, choose items they want to purchase, and calculate the total price of their selected products automatically. It also incorporates features such as GST and tax calculations, generating a detailed receipt that can be saved as a text file. This project highlights essential programming concepts like GUI design, event handling, and the use of dictionaries and functions in Python, demonstrating how Python can be used to create a functional, user-friendly application for real-world scenarios.
